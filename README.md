# FastAPI Project

## Project Overview

This comprehensive project on developing a RESTful API using FastAPI is structured around several key themes:

1. **FastAPI Basics**: This part provides a foundation of working with FastAPI, including handling different types of path operations, managing HTTP requests, applying data validation using Pydantic, and implementing CRUD operations. The significance of the path operation order and Postman for API testing are also covered.

2. **Working with Databases**: This section is dedicated to databases, explaining SQL queries, operations, and filters, along with managing databases using PgAdmin GUI. Database integration with Python for creating and retrieving posts is another focus of this section.

3. **Python and Raw SQL**: Here, the project explores setting up an application database and how to connect to it using Python. It then goes on to manage (retrieve, create, delete, and update) posts via the database.

4. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: This part of the project introduces ORMs, setting up SQLAlchemy and adding extra functionality to it. It also demonstrates how to manage posts using SQLAlchemy.

5. **Pydantic Models**: This section delves into the differences between Pydantic and ORM models and gives a detailed explanation of Pydantic Models.

6. **Authentication & Users**: This part handles user-related operations such as creating user tables, registering users, hashing passwords, retrieving user data, and managing JWT tokens for user authentication.

7. **Database Relationships**: The focus here is on SQL relationships, foreign keys, updating post schemas, managing ownership of posts, and the concept of SQLAlchemy relationships.

8. **Vote/Like System**: This part covers the creation of a voting system for the posts, explaining how to manage votes on the database level and with SQLAlchemy.

9. **Database Migration with Alembic**: This section introduces the concept of database migration tools and shows how to set up and use Alembic for database schema revisions.

10. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**: This part prepares the project for deployment by discussing concepts such as CORS and Git.

11. **Deployment**: This section covers deployment strategies for Heroku and Ubuntu, including setting up environments, managing Postgres databases, dealing with environment variables, and troubleshooting common issues.

12. **Docker**: Here, the project introduces Docker, explaining how to write a Dockerfile, set up Docker Compose, manage Postgres containers, and bind mounts.

13. **Testing**: This part emphasizes writing effective tests for the API, working with Pytest, handling database interactions in tests, and testing user authentication.

14. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline**: The final section of the project introduces CI/CD concepts, working with GitHub Actions, setting up jobs, managing environment variables, and deploying to Heroku and Ubuntu.
